# behavioral-cloning

In this project, we use a Convolutional Neural Network that incorporates multiple convolutional layers and pooling layers to train a car to drive around a track by itself at a constant speed. We will train the CNN on a collection of images and their associated steering angles so that it learns a connection between them. In autonomous mode, images recorded by the vehicle's central dashcam are fed through the CNN to predict an appropriate steering angle.

I have written a post explaining the problem and the techniques involved in the solution at https://daviderrington.net/2018/07/22/behaviour-cloning/.
